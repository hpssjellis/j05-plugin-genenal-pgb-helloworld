=================================

Just trying to see if we can test if a plugin is working using phonegap on Android



Just made a major discovery with phonegap build April 15, 2014.

If I remove the line the camera plugin does not work.

script type="text/javascript" charset="utf-8" src="cordova.js"

note:

the line could also say phonegap.js instead of cordova.



 Normally with phonegap build you do not have to include that line.
